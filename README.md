##Integrating IntelliJ with git
- https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/2016.2/using-git-integration.html

One thing that is very cool. If you have set up git for yor project 
directory the old fashion way, IntelliJ will automatically detect the 
git files and allow you to add/commit/push your code through the IDE by
clicking and keyboard shortcuts. Still ok to do ye olde way via CLI.
